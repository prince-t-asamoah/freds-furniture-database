# Database Normalization at Fred's Furniture

This project contains queries for creating a database for a fictious online furniture store named **Fred's Furniture**.  

There are two database queries:

- **store.sql**: for creating the online store database
- **store_normalize.sql**: for creating a normalized version of the store database

and a data file, **store_data.txt** which contains data for populating the store database.

Have fun!!
